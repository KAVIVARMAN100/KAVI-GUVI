When JavaScript is executed inside the browser, the window object is the JavaScript Global object.

No the window object is NOT the Global object.

When JavaScript is run in a browser all variables and functions you create are properties and methods
 of the window object.

You can access but not change any of the properties and methods of the Global object and you can override
 them be defining a similarly named property or method on the window object but they are still two entirely 
 separate objects.

window is a property of the Global object when you run JavaScript in a web browser.
